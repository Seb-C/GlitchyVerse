GlitchyVerse
============

It's a prototype of space-opera video game that I developed from scratch, using only HTML5 technologies (and WebGL), and GoLang server-side.

It includes a custom game engine, a basic collision engine and the game itself, which is not finished and not really playable.

I share it with the MIT licence.
